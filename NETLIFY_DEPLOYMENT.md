- ✅ Added missing @svgr/webpack dependency

### 📁 Netlify Files Created
- ✅ netlify.toml - Build and deployment configuration
- ✅ public/_redirects - URL redirects for SPA routing
- ✅ public/_headers - Security and performance headers

### 🗄️ Database Solution
- ✅ Replaced in-memory storage with session management
- ✅ Added session cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- ✅ Created abstraction layer for future database integration

### 🎥 APIs Enhanced
- ✅ Added HTTPS detection for camera/microphone APIs
- ✅ Graceful fallback to demo mode when APIs unavailable
- ✅ Proper error handling for production environment

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables Setup

In your Netlify dashboard, add these environment variables:

```bash
# AI API Keys (Required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key
GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_KEY=your_actual_google_ai_key
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_actual_cerebras_api_key

# Site Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-site.netlify.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Fares AI Portfolio
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_DESCRIPTION=Interactive AI-powered portfolio showcasing Fares' expertise in AI Engineering

# Feature Flags
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_VOICE=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WEBCAM=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Build Settings

In Netlify dashboard:
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `.next`
- **Node version:** 18

### 3. Domain Configuration

After deployment:
1. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` with your actual domain
2. Update `public/robots.txt` sitemap URL
3. Test all functionality

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly in both languages (EN/AR)
- [ ] AI Chat functionality works
- [ ] API routes respond correctly
- [ ] Images load properly
- [ ] Camera demos work on HTTPS (or show demo mode)
- [ ] Voice features work on HTTPS (or graceful fallback)
- [ ] CV download functionality works
- [ ] All redirects work properly
- [ ] SEO meta tags are correct

## 🔄 Future Improvements

Consider these upgrades for production:

### Database Integration
- Replace session storage with Netlify KV or Supabase
- Implement persistent chat history
- Add analytics tracking

### Performance
- Implement image optimization
- Add service worker for offline functionality
- Optimize bundle size

### Security
- Add rate limiting for API routes
- Implement CSRF protection
- Add input validation and sanitization

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **API Keys:** Never commit real API keys to version control
2. **HTTPS Required:** Camera and microphone APIs only work on HTTPS
3. **Session Storage:** Current implementation resets on deployment
4. **Fallback Mode:** Demos work even without camera/microphone access

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Netlify build logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test locally with `npm run build && npm start`
4. Check browser console for errors
